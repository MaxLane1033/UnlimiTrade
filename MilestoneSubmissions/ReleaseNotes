Changes made from last week to this week include:

GitHub Project Board is now fully operational. User stories, epics, Todo/Completed items, etc are all implemented according to the guidelines of Lab 10.

Basic files created, such as .env, docker-compose, browse.html, gitignore, index.js, etc. All of these basic file creations can be found in the GitHub repository and through the "done" tasks in our project board.

With help from our TA, we're currently copying and integrating all the files from Lab 7 into our repository. 
This will allow us to have a better base outline that people can build on. Today we struggled with many bugs, so hopefully using the Lab 7 will fix most of these basic/ground-level bugs.

Lastly, we finalized our tasks and new user stories for next week, and got a better plan going for how to avoid similar errors in the future!
